Small helper package for calculating sample sizes for various types of statistical procedures
The following types are supported at this moment:

- Logistic regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- t-test

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression with 20 covariates and the least represented class occurs in roughly 20% of the cases

```{r}
library(SampleSizeCalc)
sample_size_logistic_regression(20,0.2)
```

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression with 20 covariates r2 = 0.13, power = 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05

```{r}
sample_size_multiple_regression(20,r2=0.1304348,power=.8,alpha=0.05)
```

## t-test

A  t-test with Cohens d = 0.5, power = 0.8 and alpha = 0.05

```{r}
sample_size_2sided_2sample_t_test(0.5,.8,0.05)
```
