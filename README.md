# SampleSizeCalc
Small R package to calculate sample sizes for various types of statistical procedures. The package is designed to align with [Statcalc](http://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/).

# Supported procedures

- Logistic Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- t-tests

See the vignette for more details: [vignette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lejon/SampleSizeCalc/master/vignettes/sample_size_calc.html)

# DISCLAIMER

I take no responsibility whatsoever for any misuse of this package. It uses standard R libraries procedures for calculating the various sample sizes, but there is a lot of black magic to this topic, so you should only see the results from this library as rough guidelines.
